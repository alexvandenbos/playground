#Meal Maker

Now that we have a way to get a random dish from a course, we can create a .generateRandomMeal() function which will automatically generate a three-course meal for us. The function doesn’t need to take any parameters.

The function should create an appetizer variable which should be the result of calling the .getRandomDishFromCourse() method when we pass in an appetizers string to it.
Create a main variable and dessert variable the same way you created the appetizer variable, but make sure to pass in the right course type.
Calculates the total price and returns a string that contains the name of each of the dishes and the total price of the meal, formatted as you like.

Now that we’ve finished our menu, object, let’s use it to create a menu by adding some appetizers, mains, and desserts with the .addDishToCourse() function. Add at least 3 dishes to each course (or more if you like!).

Once your menu has items inside it, generate a meal by using the .generateRandomMeal() function on your menu, and save it to a variable called meal. Lastly, print out your meal variable to see what meal was generated for you.
